The goal of the project is to develop a 3D Mario-like only with Blueprints on Unreal Engine 4 in order to learn how to use it. I give myself the additional constraint of not using any asset from the Internet (apart from music). All models are native to Unreal, to have a correct result I allow myself to develop my own graphic effects.
